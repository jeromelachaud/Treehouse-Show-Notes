Treehouse-Show-Notes
====================


Compiled notes of the [Treehouse show](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDA5B0CD72326128) vidcast.

All links and notes that comes with every single episode have been regrouped here so it's more convinent than looking up in every show page when you want to retreive the link of this very cool website and you do not remember in which show it was mentionned.

Sorry [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), I guess you won't like that very much as it might harm your SEO a bit but hey, your show is awesome and knowledge is meant to be shared, isn't it?


CSS comes from a [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) theme made by [Boootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com) called ['Readable'](http://bootswatch.com/readable/) and served by [BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com)
